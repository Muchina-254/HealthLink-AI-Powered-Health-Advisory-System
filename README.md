🩺 HealthLink -AI-Powered  Health Advisory System

AI-Powered Health Advisory System is a digital health platform designed to support Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Kenya by enabling offline-first data collection, AI-assisted triage, and real-time reporting to national health systems.

The system bridges critical gaps in Kenya’s community health delivery by ensuring timely decision-making, improving data quality, and enhancing coordination between CHWs and healthcare facilities.

🌍 Project Overview

In many rural areas, limited connectivity, manual reporting, and fragmented data systems hinder effective community healthcare. This system provides an integrated, mobile-first solution that empowers CHWs to:

Record patient visits and symptoms offline

Use AI-based triage tools for accurate assessments

Sync data securely to a centralized cloud dashboard

Share insights with supervisors and medical officers in real time

🚨 Current Challenges

⚙️ Limited offline functionality, restricting usability in low-connectivity regions where CHWs frequently operate.
🔗 Poor integration with national and county health databases, leading to isolated records and duplicate data entry.
🧠 Lack of AI-based triage support, limiting CHWs’ ability to make data-driven clinical decisions on the ground.
💸 High operational and maintenance costs, caused by technically complex legacy systems.
🗣️ Language and cultural barriers, which reduce community engagement and understanding of health tools.
🕒 Fragmented and delayed data submission, resulting in slow response times and poor decision timelines.
💻 Weak interoperability between mobile and web systems, causing data syncing errors and inefficiencies.
🔐 Privacy and data protection vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive health information to potential misuse.
