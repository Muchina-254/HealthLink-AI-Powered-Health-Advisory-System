# AI Powered Health Advisory system

The AI-Powered Health Advisory System is a mobile-first digital platform designed to revolutionize community healthcare delivery in rural Kenya. It empowers Community Health Workers (CHWs) with intelligent, offline-capable tools for triage, referrals, and data management.

The system combines a Flutter mobile app, a FastAPI backend with hybrid rule-based and machine learning models, and a React dashboard for health administrators. It provides real-time triage guidance, automates referrals, and syncs health data securely to the cloud when connectivity is available.

Built to operate in low-resource and low-connectivity environments, the platform improves clinical decision-making, ensures accurate data reporting, and supports Kenya’s vision for digital, data-driven community healthcare.

💡 Prototype implementation focuses on Siaya County and common ailments such as fever, cough, diarrhea, and convulsions.
