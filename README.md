## 🩺 HealthLink -AI-Powered  Health Advisory System

AI-Powered Health Advisory System is a digital health platform designed to support Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Kenya by enabling offline-first data collection, AI-assisted triage, and real-time reporting to national health systems.

The system bridges critical gaps in Kenya’s community health delivery by ensuring timely decision-making, improving data quality, and enhancing coordination between CHWs and healthcare facilities.

Record patient visits and symptoms offline

Use AI-based triage tools for accurate assessments

Sync data securely to a centralized cloud dashboard

Share insights with supervisors and medical officers in real time
